# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The requirements and goals of this Weight Tracking app are to include a database with three tables: one to store user login information, the user’s goal weight, and all the daily weights the user has added. There are three screens: a login screen with an account creation mechanism, a screen that lists all the user’s daily weights, and a settings screen where the user can change their goal weight and enable SMS notifications. The user needs this app was designed to address was to allow a user to track their daily weight and notify them once they have reached their goal weight. My UI designs kept users in mind by keeping the UI simple, intuitive, and follow a logical flow (Login screen -> Weights Screen -> Settings). My designs were successful because they look appealing to the user and the information is presented to the user in a clean, lightweight, list format.


# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

This is an area I could improve on. I approached the process of coding my app by diving headfirst into Android Studio and writing the code immediately. What I should have done is drawn up some sketches, diagrams, or flow charts so that I wouldn’t waste time coding something only to realize later on that what I was trying to accomplish wasn’t going to work or required too much of a workaround.


# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by running my app in the Android emulator. I also used the debugger to determine the cause of failure if the app happened to crash while testing. This process is important as it allows you to use the app as a user would and you can catch bugs and defects before compiling the app into an APK file.


# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate when I realized that parts of my initial layout were not going to work with where I had envisioned the finalized app. I had to build out a new weights screen UI as I needed to add a FAB button in the bottom right of the screen that would allow the user to add a daily weight. I could not figure out how to add it with the layout I initially had, so I had to figure out how to add in a FrameLayout that would enable me to add a FAB button.


# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? 

I was particularly successful in creating a fully functional login screen that provides relevant feedback to the user based on the inputs they provide. This component demonstrates my knowledge and skills that I’ve learned from designing and developing Android apps, from understanding how to design a UI to using Android-specific objects.
